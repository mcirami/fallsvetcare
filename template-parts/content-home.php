								<span>Dr. Gina Bauman, or as most of her clients know her Dr. Gina, was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri.</span>
								For as long as she can recall she always wanted to move to Florida.  As early as the age of 6 she would save her quarters in a piggy bank her aunt gave her to make her big move south to see the pelicans.
								After graduating vet school from the University of Missouri, as one of eight children, all of whom still reside in St. Louis, she was the “wandering soul” who left her home town to pursue her childhood dream.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once she arrived on the Emerald Coast’s beaches and absorbed the small town feel she immediately knew she made the right choice.
								She and her husband have been enjoying the quaint, beach town feel ever since. As Navarre and her family grew, she is now a mother of two, one thing remains clear.
								The small town feel and southern hospitality that made her fall in love with this beautiful area makes her want to respond to and pay back her community with the same openness and warmth she felt since first arriving.
								She describes being able to practice veterinary medicine as a gift and getting to care for and improve the lives of innocent animals and their human companions a privilege.
								She feels as though it is a journey that she gets to take along with the owners to see an animal progress and mature in their lives together and follow that journey from beginning to end.
								No other profession can provide her with such emotional ups, downs and learning and what a ride it has been so far!

								<span>Carrie is a Florida native born in Clearwater but grew up in an Air Force family that moved her all over the country.</span>
								Though she lived in beautiful areas, nothing could compare to the Emerald Coast where she planted her roots for the past 25 years.
							</p>
							<p>
								She has been in the veterinary field for 20 years and enjoys spending her free time with her husband Brett boating in the summers and cheering on her Saints and Georgia Bulldogs during football seasons.
								Carrie has 2 adult children (Andi and Taylor) and her family also includes her 3 dogs (Mayhem, Ruckis and Fury) and 6 cats (Freedom, Fortune, Ferrari, Gilley, Momma and Kirby) all of whom are rescues that adopted her!
